		<h5 class = "policysmallheading">History of Kiboko</h5>
		<p class = "content">Kiboko is a travel agency specialised in organizing safaris in the African savanna. We have headquarters in Brisbane and, since we cooperates with African companies to plan and operate trips, we also have offices in Cape Town, South Africa, and Nairobi, Kenya. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Kiboko has been trusted by Australian travelers since 1986. We believe our focus on sustainable traveling is what made us so trustworthy - we bring tourists to the best spots without abusing of the welcoming and charming character of African indigenous communities.
		<br>
		<br>
		We started off as a family business, then connected with some friends in Africa and developed some tight relationships with a couple of different Drivers companies in Kenya and South Africa. We currently operate by word of mouth and traveling magazine ads, solely in Australia, but we would like to expand our marketing campaigns to the web as we would improve the way our clients get to know us and familiarise with our services.</p>
